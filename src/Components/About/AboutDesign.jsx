              <div><p>At Job Ready, our story goes beyond entrepreneurship—it is a journey shared by countless international students in the UK. When we, the founders of Job Ready, first arrived in this country, we came with grand aspirations, only to be met with significant challenges. Like many others, we invested in renowned educational institutions, with the hope of securing top-tier career opportunities. Yet, the reality we faced was vastly different.</p></div>

              <div><p>From navigating visa complexities to addressing skill gaps, we quickly realised that the barriers we encountered were not a reflection of our talent or determination, but rather the result of a system we were unprepared for. This is not just our story; it mirrors the experiences of countless international students striving for success, yet often being held back—not by their potential, but by a lack of proper guidance and opportunity.</p></div>
